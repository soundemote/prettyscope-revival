# Host Integration Notes

This is the current integration shape for a future JUCE/CLAP shell.

`examples/host_bridge_example.cpp` is a small compiled example of the public
core API without creating an OpenGL window.

## Public Include

Use:

```cpp
#include "prettyscope.hpp"
```

Avoid including internal renderer headers from the plugin shell unless the shell
is actively extending renderer internals.

## OpenGL Lifecycle

Create one `prettyscope::ScopeEngine` for the editor/view that owns the OpenGL
context.

```cpp
prettyscope::ScopeEngine scope(1024);
scope.initialize();
// render callbacks...
scope.shutdown();
```

Call `initialize()` and `shutdown()` while the OpenGL context is current.

## Audio Handoff

Use `ExternalSignalSource` as the bridge from host audio buffers.

```cpp
prettyscope::ExternalSignalSource source;
source.reserve(maxBlockSize);
source.setInputChannels(channels, channelCount, sampleCount);
scope.advance(source, dt);
```

`ExternalSignalSource` synchronizes access internally, so a first plugin build can
feed it from a host callback while the editor renders on another callback. Call
`reserve()` during prepare/setup to avoid routine vector growth. If profiling
shows the lock matters, replace this bridge with a lock-free handoff later.

When audio and OpenGL arrive on different callbacks, update the source from the
audio side, then render the current signal from the OpenGL/editor side:

```cpp
scope.renderCurrentSignal(width, height);
```

## Controls

Bind float controls through `VisualFloatParameterId` and the normalized helpers:

```cpp
prettyscope::setNormalizedVisualFloatParameter(
    scope.params(),
    prettyscope::VisualFloatParameterId::TraceGain,
    normalizedValue);
```

Bind toggles through `VisualBoolParameterId`, and menu/choice controls through
`VisualChoiceParameterId`. Choice setters update `clearRevision` where the
persistence buffer needs a visual reset.

## Palettes

Use `visualPalettes()` to list named palettes and `applyVisualPalette()` to
apply one. The standalone `C` key uses the same palette list.
