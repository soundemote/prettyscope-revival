# Console Memory

## Identity

Console owns the Asciiscope lane:

- terminal-first ASCII oscilloscope visuals
- social-media-ready console animations
- Asciiscope CLAP visual/plugin path
- practical signal-to-visual experiments

Keep Asciiscope independent. The plugin should adapt to Asciiscope concepts; Asciiscope should not become a plugin project.

## Asciiscope Direction

Asciiscope should feel like a real terminal instrument:

- visible motion first
- waveform traces and trails
- mousewheel zoom
- click/drag center shifting
- readouts for interactive controls
- default demos should be immediately recordable
- real executable output beats fake mockups

The terminal app can keep evolving fast. Avoid overbuilding shared architecture until the visual language proves what it needs.

## CLAP/JUCE Direction

Do not host a real OS console inside the plugin editor.

Asciiscope CLAP should recreate the console/phosphor look using JUCE:

- dark editor background
- monospaced glyph cells
- fading trail memory
- signal-driven ASCII scope behavior
- audio snapshot path from engine to editor
- visual component fed by real block-shaped data when possible

Current renderer strategy:

```text
audio snapshot -> visual state -> AsciiscopeVisualFrame -> JUCE Graphics draw pass
```

Renderer direction is CPU-first and sample-aware. The base renderer should build glyph fields, trace memory, interpolation, and trail aging from the signal timeline so audio/visual behavior can stay coherent at the highest useful temporal density.

GPU work is deferred and should be treated as an effects/output layer after CPU visual state:

- default renderer remains CPU/JUCE Graphics
- GPU may add glow, bloom, phosphor diffusion, feedback, capture surfaces, or Syphon/Spout-style output
- use a dedicated visual component/context only if needed
- do not make OpenGL the implied migration target for the core renderer
- do not make the whole plugin editor depend on a GPU context
- do not replace ASCII identity with generic shader visuals

## Boundaries

Do not add `IVisualSurface` yet unless a concrete JUCE/OpenGL or terminal/plugin split requires it.

Do not couple Asciiscope directly to soemdsp-sandbox internals.

Future integration boundary should be neutral signal frames:

```text
SignalFrame / SignalSource
VisualizationBus / probe feed
SandboxSignalInput adapter later
```

Scene/render code should consume signal frames, not circuits, nodes, ports, or sandbox runtime structures.

## Communication

Report to Vision only at:

- milestone complete
- commit made
- blocker
- architecture boundary
- cross-repo risk
- request for shared abstraction

Do not report every local edit, build, UI tweak, or routine debug step.

Architect does not want push reminders. Focus on commits and implementation reports.

## Stamps

Use stamped messages only for handoffs/reports, not casual discussion.

Current two-line handoff format:

```text
[received: Sender->Receiver: xxxx]
[sent: Sender->Receiver: yyyy]
```

The received stamp repeats the stamp being answered. The sent stamp is fresh and final.

## Git Habits

Make small commits after meaningful changes.

Do not force reset, rewrite history, or force push.

Do not touch submodules or dependency commits unless explicitly asked.

Respect dirty worktrees and user changes. If another repo has unrelated changes, leave them alone.
