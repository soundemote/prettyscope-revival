# Active Threads

Durable active-thread memory for Vision.

This file tracks the current agent tasks, active stamps, repo states, and open loops that Vision should remember across chat context loss.

Update this file when an active task changes, a major report arrives, or a thread is closed.

## How To Use This File

This is not a full history.

This is the current operating board.

Keep it compact.

Track:

* active task per agent
* latest relevant stamp
* current repo state if important
* blockers
* next expected report
* decisions that should not be forgotten

## Stamp Rule

Formal threads use:

```
[received: Sender→Receiver: xxxx]
[sent: Sender→Receiver: xxxx]
```

The active stamp for a task is usually the last Vision→Agent task instruction.

Side acknowledgments do not automatically replace the active task thread.

If unsure, ask Architect which thread is active.

## Codex Active Thread

Agent:

```
Codex
```

Repo:

```
C:\Users\argit\Desktop\soemdsp
```

Ownership:

* `soemdsp`
* `soemdsp-sandbox`
* core runtime
* DSP binding
* ControlGraph
* validation/reporting/export
* future sandbox spine

Current focus:

```
DSP binding proof ladder moving toward caller-owned manual processing,
while avoiding scheduler/API/plugin creep.
```

Recent completed work:

* DSP binding apply batch aggregate demo
* manual DSP object processing chain demo
* manual DSP object processing chain resync demo

Important recent repo event:

* `.codex/AGENTS.md` divergence resolved
* local removal won
* canonical docs now live in CODEGUIDE
* merge commit: `e437f77 Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'`
* repo became no longer behind origin

Current/last assigned Codex task:

```
Add manual DSP object block processing demo.
```

Task goal:

```
Prove that after DSP binding apply syncs Circuit parameters into external memory,
a caller-owned chain of low-level DSP objects can manually process a small block
of samples using those synced values.
```

Expected demo:

* TinyGainDsp
* TinyBiasDsp
* gain = 2.0
* bias = 0.25
* input block:

  * 0.0
  * 0.25
  * 0.5
  * 1.0
* expected output block:

  * 0.25
  * 0.75
  * 1.25
  * 2.25

Current active stamp:

```
[received: Codex→Vision: h9q2]
[sent: Vision→Codex: w3n7]
```

Repo-status policy:

* Codex reports repo status only
* no push recommendations unless Architect asks
* if behind origin, pause risky new coding and inspect

Next expected Codex report:

```
Completion report for runtime_dsp_object_manual_block_demo.cpp
```

Watch for:

* scheduler temptation
* production batch API temptation
* graph-owned DSP object storage
* plugin abstraction creep
* ControlGraph shaping leaking into DSP binding
* behind-origin divergence

## Console Active Thread

Agent:

```
Console
```

Repos:

* `asciiscope`
* `asciiscope-clap`

Ownership:

* Asciiscope terminal visuals
* Asciiscope CLAP plugin visual path
* ASCII/terminal visual lane
* SignalFrame / SignalSource concepts

Current pressure level:

```
light / milestone-based
```

Current state:

* Asciiscope remains independent and terminal-first
* Asciiscope CLAP identity rename completed
* JUCE visual component added
* `ui::AsciiscopeVisualComponent` exists
* component is owned by `MainPanel`
* ticked by `PluginEditor::idle()` at 60 Hz
* currently fed from existing VU/scalar data
* audio snapshot path was recommended as next major milestone

Likely next Console milestone:

```
Add lightweight audio-to-visual snapshot boundary for Asciiscope CLAP.
```

Guidance:

* Console does not need to report every local edit
* report milestones, blockers, commits, repo unsafe state, or boundary decisions
* no premature `IVisualSurface`
* no direct `soemdsp-sandbox` coupling
* no collision with Tracer

Relevant shared guidance:

```
Console and Tracer may diverge freely inside their own repos.
The key is preserving extraction seams:
- where signal enters
- where state updates
- where drawing/rendering happens
- what is reusable core
- what is plugin/editor shell
```

Latest known Console stamp:

```
[received: Console→Vision: y7d4m]
[sent: Vision→Console: p4s8]
```

This may be stale if Console has since received light-guidance messages.

## Tracer Active Thread

Agent:

```
Tracer
```

Repos:

* `prettyscope`
* `prettyscope-clap`

Ownership:

* Prettyscope OpenGL/phosphor visual lane
* Prettyscope CLAP plugin path
* visual parameter descriptors
* audio snapshot queue
* OpenGL editor view
* renderer adapter path
* future golden renderer port

Current pressure level:

```
light / milestone-based
```

Current state:

* descriptor-owned visual parameters proven
* Sidequest Patch/Param adapter exists
* editor parameter panel exists
* snapshot inspector exists
* first OpenGL scope view exists
* simple XY line-strip renderer fed from ScopeAudioSnapshot
* renderer adapter boundary was recommended next

Likely next Tracer milestone:

```
Add scope renderer adapter boundary around current OpenGL XY proof renderer.
```

Guidance:

* Tracer does not need to report every local edit
* report milestones, blockers, commits, repo unsafe state, or boundary decisions
* descriptors remain source of truth
* Sidequest/JUCE/CLAP plumbing adapts to descriptors
* do not port golden renderer blindly
* do not remove inherited synth/MIDI/voice concepts too early

Relevant shared guidance:

```
Console and Tracer code divergence is acceptable.
The concern is not sameness.
The concern is extraction seams.
```

Latest known Tracer stamp:

```
[received: Tracer→Vision: t3k7]
[sent: Vision→Tracer: h5m2]
```

This may be stale if Tracer has since received light-guidance messages.

## Void Active Thread

Agent:

```
Void
```

Role:

```
Separate browser-native creative sandbox and Soundemote website lane.
```

Normal routing:

```
Void works directly with Architect.
```

Void is not part of the normal routed agent mesh.

Current state:

* Void is working happily with Architect on the Soundemote website
* Void created a Prettyscope-like web plugin / web visual experiment
* Void acts as a sketchpad for DSP/audio-visual interaction while the real `soemdsp-sandbox` does not exist yet

Guidance:

* Void can explore freely
* Void does not need to wait for the real sandbox
* Void should not define core runtime architecture
* Void discoveries can later be routed into Codex/Console/Tracer/DIRECTOR if Architect decides they are useful

No active formal stamp required unless Architect routes a Void discovery into the formal system.

## DIRECTOR Active Thread

Agent:

```
DIRECTOR
```

Role:

* business
* money
* audience
* public strategy
* social media
* YouTube
* offers
* commissions
* finished creative product strategy

Normal routing:

```
DIRECTOR mostly speaks directly with Architect.
```

Current strategy:

```
Soundemote tools are gravity, not the fenced-off product.
```

Money path:

* finished music
* audiovisual releases
* commissioned audiovisual pieces
* sound design
* sound packs
* sample packs
* custom visuals
* plugin-powered art
* Hydrus when ready
* creative products made with the ecosystem

Guidance:

* no begging
* no shallow hype
* do not rush Hydrus
* do not interrupt engineering agents unless Architect/Vision routes a bounded request
* help Architect create practical offers and public proof

Potential next DIRECTOR output:

* simple commission / offer menu
* first public positioning statement
* 7-day content plan
* concrete “what can be posted today” plan

Latest known DIRECTOR formal stamp:

```
[received: DIRECTOR→Vision: center-strategy]
[sent: Vision→DIRECTOR: g8r4]
```

DIRECTOR does not need stamps for ordinary business discussion with Architect.

## CODEGUIDE Active Thread

Repo:

```
https://github.com/soundemote/prettyscope-revival/tree/main/CODEGUIDE
```

Purpose:

```
canonical company/agent/code guidance
```

Current state:

* AGENTS overview exists
* agent files exist
* protocols exist
* templates exist
* push policy simplified
* communication cadence updated
* completion report template updated
* task template updated
* cross-agent handoff template corrected
* Vision file updated
* Vision memory bank being created

Current Vision memory files planned:

* `soundemote_current_state.md`
* `architecture_invariants.md`
* `active_threads.md`
* `business_strategy.md`
* `glossary.md`

This file is the third of those five.

Guidance:

* CODEGUIDE is company infrastructure, not overhead
* it is currently housed in `prettyscope-revival` for tactical/public reasons
* avoid stale duplicated local agent docs
* old `.codex/AGENTS.md` should not become canonical again

## Open Management Decisions

Current big-ticket technical focus:

```
Codex / soemdsp / soemdsp-sandbox
```

Other agents:

```
light pressure, milestone cadence
```

Void:

```
separate/private creative sandbox with Architect
```

Pushes:

```
Architect / DIRECTOR push every little while
agents report repo status only
```

Abstractions:

```
freeze production abstractions until repeated proofs make the shape unavoidable
```

## Active Risks

High:

* premature scheduler in `soemdsp`
* production batch API too early
* repo divergence/behind-origin states
* old local docs conflicting with CODEGUIDE

Medium:

* Director pulling engineering agents into public work too early
* Console/Tracer adding shared abstractions too soon
* Void sketches being mistaken for runtime architecture
* stale active stamps

Low:

* Console/Tracer visual code divergence by itself
* high routing load when stamps are clean

## Current Priority

Keep Codex moving through small runtime proofs.

Keep CODEGUIDE usable as Vision memory.

Keep other agents light.

Keep Soundemote becoming harder to ignore.
