# Soundemote Current State

Durable state snapshot for Vision.

This file exists so Vision can reload the current Soundemote operating map without depending only on chat context.

## Current Date Context

Current push context:

* 58 days left in the current runway/push
* Architect is actively coordinating multiple agents
* Codex is the main big-ticket technical focus
* Console, Tracer, DIRECTOR, and Void are active but should not overload Vision routing
* Architect should not be asked for hands-on testing of CLI demos; save hands-on testing requests for mouse interaction, audible output, or visual inspection
* Architect should keep being used for difficult-to-confirm widget interactions, browser-native media behavior, mouse behavior, and audible/visual matching
* Vision is aware of time only when checking a clock or when Architect reports time; record important time/runway updates here
* latest Architect time update: Day 2, 11:39 PM
* local machine clock near that update: 2026-05-25 23:40:20 -07:00
* Architect may continue having Vision work through part of the night because continuing can be driven by simple `continue` prompts

* Vision is currently allowed to use maximum/Extra High thought processing; it is worthwhile for architecture-sensitive boundary decisions, but mechanical edits do not inherently require it

## Soundemote Short Description

Soundemote is an audio-visual DSP technology company creating multiplatform audio plugins and video FX generators with analog aesthetics for modern multiplatform frameworks.

## Core Company Direction

Soundemote is becoming a creative audio-visual technology ecosystem.

The ecosystem includes:

* `soemdsp`
* `soemdsp-sandbox`
* `asciiscope`
* `asciiscope-clap`
* `prettyscope`
* `prettyscope-clap`
* Soundemote website
* browser-native creative sketches
* future Hydrus work
* future finished music, audiovisual, and creative products

Soundemote should become a center of gravity for:

* plugin development
* audio FX
* visual FX
* DSP tools
* creative audio technology
* audio-reactive visuals
* modular prototyping
* analog-aesthetic video generators
* multiplatform plugin and visual frameworks

## Strategic Frame

## CODEGUIDE State

Canonical guidance now lives in:

```
https://github.com/soundemote/prettyscope-revival/tree/main/CODEGUIDE
```

Important CODEGUIDE areas:

* `AGENTS.md`
* `agents/*.md`
* `protocols/stamps.md`
* `protocols/communication_cadence.md`
* `protocols/push_policy.md`
* `templates/task.md`
* `templates/completion_report.md`
* `templates/cross_agent_handoff.md`
* `agents/VISION/memory/*.md`

Old repo-local `.codex/AGENTS.md` in `soemdsp` is obsolete/removed.

## soemdsp / soemdsp-sandbox State

Owner: Vision, with Codex available only as optional pasted historical context.

Current focus:

* `soemdsp` core runtime
* DSP binding
* runtime graph foundation
* first local `soemdsp-sandbox`
* future full modular `soemdsp-sandbox`

Current runtime foundation includes:

* Circuit runtime
* nodes
* ports
* connections
* audio/control/trigger routing
* stable IDs
* reflection metadata
* layout/editor metadata
* debug printing
* runtime query helpers
* parameter lifecycle helpers
* normalized parameter transport
* parameter snapshots
* CircuitSnapshot
* CircuitReport
* validation diagnostics
* text export helpers
* ControlGraph
* ControlGraph reports/snapshots/exports
* ControlGraph target validation
* safe ControlGraph apply to Circuit
* curve/scale settings
* midpoint curve support
* parameter `midValue`
* DSP object contract docs
* DSP binding metadata
* DSP binding validation
* DSP binding target validation
* DSP binding reports
* DSP binding apply result reports
* DSP binding apply summaries

Important proven DSP binding path:

```
Circuit parameter
    -> DspParameterBinding
    -> external memory slot
    -> low-level DSP object reads that memory
```

Recent proven demos include:

* parameter sync into external memory
* missing target failure
* null memory slot failure
* null DSP memory target validation before apply writes
* unsupported DSP target kind validation before apply writes
* DSP binding validation demo now distinguishes unsupported target-kind validation from null-memory validation
* apply result text export
* contract-style DSP object sync
* repeated resync after Circuit parameter change
* multi-parameter DSP object sync
* multi-node DSP object sync
* multi-node failure all-or-nothing proof
* apply summaries
* sequential caller-level batch apply
* mixed caller-level batch apply
* caller-level batch aggregate demo
* manual DSP object processing chain demo
* manual DSP object processing chain resync demo
* manual DSP object block processing demo
* manual DSP object block resync demo
* manual DSP object block resync demo now reports separate first/resynced block phases through DspBlockPhaseReport
* manual DSP object block preflight failure demo
* manual DSP object block preflight recovery demo
* manual DSP object block null-memory recovery demo
* manual DSP object block phase report demo
* reusable DSP block phase report value type and print helper
* DSP block phase report text export helper
* DSP block preflight failure demo now reports failed preflight and skipped processing through DspBlockPhaseReport
* DSP execution questions doc clarified around reusable report helpers versus blocked execution machinery
* DSP execution questions doc records independent phase reports for resync block passes
* DSP execution questions doc
* runtime audio sine WAV demo
* runtime Circuit audio path can render a short mono WAV artifact through SineOscillator -> AudioOutput
* bound DSP object WAV demo
* synced Circuit frequency/amplitude parameters can drive a caller-owned DSP object that renders an audible WAV artifact
* bound DSP object WAV resync demo
* changed Circuit frequency/amplitude parameters can resync into external DSP memory between two halves of an audible WAV artifact
* bound DSP object WAV resync demo now reports each render half through DspBlockPhaseReport
* examples-only mono WAV writer helper
* audible demos share `examples/WriteMono16Wav.hpp` without making it a runtime API
* audible demos can print and write compact WAV artifact metadata reports
* bound DSP object WAV resync demo writes a combined render summary with setter status, both phase reports, and WAV artifact metadata
* bound DSP object WAV resync demo writes a demo-local HTML audio report with browser-native audio controls and status sections
* bound DSP object WAV resync demo writes a demo-local JSON artifact manifest for inspection
* bound DSP object WAV resync HTML report links the generated WAV, manifest, text summary, WAV metadata report, and phase reports as one local inspection packet
* root-level runtime demo reports and inspection artifacts are gitignored so hands-on demo runs do not dirty source status
* bound DSP object WAV resync manifest includes a demo-local sandbox handoff contract naming the HTML entry point and WAV artifact for mouse-and-ears inspection
* docs/SANDBOX_HANDOFF_CONTRACT.md documents the versioned read-only sandbox handoff contract and its non-meanings
* bound DSP object WAV resync manifest includes display-ready artifact links for read-only sandbox shells
* docs/SANDBOX_HANDOFF_CONSUMER_CHECKLIST.md records accept/display/reject rules for a future read-only sandbox manifest consumer
* first local `soemdsp-sandbox` repo exists at `C:\Users\argit\Desktop\soemdsp-sandbox`
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell is a Python-stdlib server plus static browser UI
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell reads the generated `soemdsp` manifest and serves the WAV/artifact packet read-only
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell visibly applies the read-only consumer checklist and surfaces unsafe/unsupported manifest states as warnings
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell draws a read-only waveform from the generated WAV
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell overlays phase regions on the waveform and exposes phase view controls
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell derives phase time ranges, durations, and WAV share from manifest phase sample counts and WAV metadata
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell displays the current waveform phase and highlights the active phase button
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell displays the current waveform cursor frame and decoded sample value
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell decouples waveform view controls from native audio seeking to avoid slider/audio reset loops
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell exposes a Follow Audio / Free View toggle for choosing audio-following transport view or independent waveform inspection
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell displays parameter resync values from the generated text summary
* first `soemdsp-sandbox` shell displays parameter resync deltas and ratios from the generated text summary

Recent completion:

```
7dba5e4 Show waveform sample cursor
```

The first local `soemdsp-sandbox` shell now displays the current waveform cursor frame and decoded sample value next to the time and phase pills.

Verification passed in the live browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`: browser verification reported toggle `Follow Audio`, waveform position `0.000s`, sample cursor `frame 0 / sample 0`, current phase `first`, `Waveform: Drawn`, `Checklist: Accepted`, zero warning rows, no horizontal overflow, and no console errors.

Generated preview screenshot:

```

This remains at Architect's hands-on testing threshold because it has mouse interaction, visual inspection value, and audible output.

## Vision Takeover / Codex Context

Architect is moving Vision into the primary `soemdsp` / `soemdsp-sandbox` implementation role.

Current working model:

```
Vision = Soundemote DSP/sandbox mind, task author, and bounded direct editor when Architect assigns implementation work.
Codex = optional historical context / helper agent if Architect pastes Codex reports or asks Vision to consult Codex.
```

Current stance:

* Vision should inspect and edit `soemdsp` directly when Architect asks.
* Architect may paste Codex context into Vision when useful.
* Vision should ask Architect only when Codex context is actually needed.
* Architect remains final authority.
* Codex may be phased out once Vision has absorbed enough code context.

## Current Codex Repo State To Remember

Codex resolved a divergence involving old `.codex/AGENTS.md`.

Resolution:

* remote had `2295339 Update AGENTS.md`
* local had `a7cf626 moving AGENTS.md out of repository`
* local removal won
* merge commit created: `e437f77 Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'`
* canonical agent docs now live in CODEGUIDE
* repo was clean afterward
* main was ahead of origin by local commits and no longer behind

Do not revive `.codex/AGENTS.md` as canonical.

## Asciiscope / Console State

Owner: Console.

Repos:

* `asciiscope`
* `asciiscope-clap`

Asciiscope current concepts:

* terminal-first visual instrument
* ASCII oscilloscope/social animations
* `ISignalInput`
* `SignalFrame`
* `SignalSource`
* `SignalSample`
* `SignalStats`
* `DemoSignalInput`
* `AnimationScene`
* `ConsoleRenderer`

Boundary:

```
ISignalInput
    -> SignalFrame
    -> AnimationScene
    -> ConsoleRenderer
```

Asciiscope CLAP current state:

* plugin identity renamed to Asciiscope CLAP
* CMake project/product identity updated
* bundle/plugin ID updated
* manufacturer metadata updated
* README updated
* patch extension changed to `.ascope`
* JUCE visual component added
* `ui::AsciiscopeVisualComponent`
* visual component owned by `MainPanel`
* ticked by existing `PluginEditor::idle()` at 60 Hz
* currently fed by existing `UPDATE_VU` left/right values
* draws dark console-style glyph waveform/grid

Console should work in milestone chunks.

Do not force shared `IVisualSurface` yet.

## Prettyscope / Tracer State

Owner: Tracer.

Repos:

* `prettyscope`
* `prettyscope-clap`

Prettyscope direction:

* OpenGL/phosphor/GPU visualizer
* golden standalone renderer look
* plugin path through CLAP/JUCE

Prettyscope CLAP current state:

* renamed CLAP/JUCE shell
* stereo input/output
* host audio passthrough
* engine stores `scopeInput`
* `ScopeAudioSnapshot`
* `ScopeAudioSnapshotQueue`
* editor subscribes while alive
* editor drains newest snapshot during idle
* visual descriptor registry exists
* descriptor-to-Sidequest Patch/Param adapter exists
* descriptor string IDs preserved
* descriptor numeric IDs used as plugin/host parameter IDs
* tests added for descriptor mapping and roundtrip
* editor-visible `Visual Parameters` panel exists
* parameters include:

  * `phosphor_decay`
  * `beam_intensity`
  * `input_gain`
  * `time_scale`
* `ScopeSnapshotInspector` exists
* `ScopeOpenGLView` exists
* simple XY line-strip renderer fed from snapshot
* first OpenGL lifecycle proof complete
* renderer adapter boundary was recommended/active

Tracer should not port golden renderer blindly.

Descriptors are truth.

Sidequest/JUCE/CLAP plumbing adapts to descriptors.

## Void State

Void is separate from normal routed agent workflow.

Void works directly with Architect.

Void owns:

* Soundemote website
* browser-native visuals
* web-native DSP/audio-visual sketches
* Prettyscope-like web experiments
* future WebAudio/WebGL/WebGPU ideas

Void has created a Prettyscope-like web plugin / web visual experiment.

Void is a creative sketchpad while the actual `soemdsp-sandbox` does not exist yet.

Void can inspire other projects, but does not define core runtime architecture.

## DIRECTOR State

DIRECTOR owns business/public strategy.

DIRECTOR should mostly speak directly with Architect.

DIRECTOR helps with:

* social media
* YouTube
* public strategy
* offers
* commissions
* money path
* audience growth
* finished creative products

DIRECTOR should contact Vision only when cross-agent alignment or technical accuracy is needed.

Important DIRECTOR strategy:

* tools create gravity
* finished works make money
* no begging
* no shallow hype
* do not rush Hydrus

## Push Policy State

Push bandwidth is limited.

Architect / DIRECTOR push every little while.

Agents should not recommend pushes by default.

Agents report repo status only:

* working tree clean / dirty
* ahead of origin by N commits
* behind origin by N commits
* conflicts if any

Mention push only when Architect asks or when a task explicitly requires remote state.

## Attention Convention State

When any agent needs to get Architect's attention, the next report or reply should begin and end with:

```
Attention: Architect
```

At the top, leave one blank line before additional text.

At the bottom, leave one blank line after the final normal line, then repeat the attention line as the final line.

If Architect does not respond after the first attention-marked reply, keep using the same top-and-bottom attention convention on later reports/replies until Architect sees it or the issue is cleared.

This convention is now recorded in the main agent document, the individual agent documents, Vision reboot, and the completion report template.

## Current Risk Focus

Highest coding risks:

* premature scheduler
* production batch API too early
* graph-owned DSP object storage
* plugin abstraction creeping into core runtime
* ControlGraph shaping leaking into DSP binding
* repo behind/divergence states

Highest agent risks:

* unclear active stamp thread
* old local docs conflicting with CODEGUIDE
* agents over-reporting
* stale Codex context being mistaken for current repo truth
* Director accidentally becoming engineering router
* Void sketches being mistaken for runtime architecture

Current mitigation:

* small proofs
* clear stamps
* CODEGUIDE canonical docs
* Vision direct inspection before implementation
* no push recommendations by default
* abstraction freeze rule
* Codex tight cadence
* Console/Tracer milestone cadence
* Void separate
* DIRECTOR mostly direct with Architect

## Current Success Standard

The current push does not require everything to be finished.

The goal is for Soundemote to become undeniable.

Undeniable means people can see, hear, run, follow, trust, and eventually buy into what Architect is building.

Keep Soundemote becoming harder to ignore.
